### Introduction{data-width=500}
  
This report aims to analyze the changes in the victims of various crimes in Australia from 2010 to 2019. We hope to find some problems by analyzing the data: From the perspective of state, gender and age, how have the victims of various crimes changed in the past ten years?


The report is based on [victim data](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/people/crime-and-justice/recorded-crime-victims/latest-release) from the [Australian Bureau of Statistics](https://www.abs.gov.au/). It is a data set generated by regular judicial and criminal investigations and aims to provide the number and rate of victims across Australia in terms of state, gender and age. All ABS data displayed on this website are provided under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 international license. It is open data and can be shared freely and adapted for any purpose.

### Analysis{data-width=250}  
  
* On the whole, it shows an upward trend year by year recently.  
* The number of female victims is much higher than that of male victims, almost twice.  

* With the exception of sexual assault and kidnapping, the majority of victims are men.
* The vast majority of cases are sexual assaults.  
* The number of robberies among the remaining crime categories is also considerable. (Including both armed and unarmed)  
* Possible reasons:
  + Women generally have stronger safety awareness
  + Women are less likely to be seen alone at night in areas where they are likely to be robbed  
    
According to statistics of gender-specific crimes in various countries, male victims are the majority in almost all crimes except for sex-related crimes in which more women are victims.

### Sexual assault proportion {data-width=450}



```{r echo=FALSE}
Victims_of_Crime_sum <- Victims_of_Crime_tidy %>% 
  filter(!Gender == "All") %>% 
  group_by(Gender, Year) %>% 
  summarise(sum = sum(Number))

Take sexual assault, female victims of sexual assault make up a very high proportion of total female victims.

### Analysis 
  
* Rate is calculated by victim number divided by 100,000 persons.
* Show an upward pattern over years.
* Higher than 0.15% in recent years which means 3 out of every 2,000 people have been sexually assaulted.
* Possible reasons:
  + Women are physically vulnerable
  + Men are more sexually impulsive
  + Many women may choose not to report the crime
    - relationship to the offender
    - confidence in the justice system
    - fear of revenge
    - public opinion  
  
ABS personal safety survey also measures the number of women who contacted the police about the most recent incident within the last 10 years. Only 13.4% of women did so.

### Age Group
I divided age into four groups

* 0-19 years old Teenage

* 20–34 years old Adult

* 35–54 years old Elder Adult

* 55 years and over Elder

Row
----------------------------------

### Trend
```{r}
Year <- 2010:2019
tibble(Year, teenage, adult, elder_adult, elder) -> age_total
age_total %>%
  mutate(Year = as.numeric(Year)) -> age

ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(x=Year, y = teenage), data =age %>% select(Year, teenage)) +
  ggtitle("Teenage") -> p_teenage
ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(x=Year, y = adult), data = age %>% select(Year, adult)) +
  ggtitle("adult") -> p_adult
ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(x=Year, y = elder_adult), data = age %>% select(Year, elder_adult)) +
  ggtitle("elder_adult") -> p_elder_adult
ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(x=Year, y = elder), data =age %>% select(Year, elder)) +
  ggtitle("elder") -> p_elder
grid.arrange(p_teenage, p_adult, p_elder_adult, p_elder)
```

Row {data-height=80}
----------------------------------
### Analysis

From graph, we can see that the trend for both teenage and adult is very similar. it has a decrease trend from 2010 to 2015. Then, it has a increase trend from 2015 to 2019. For the elder adult and elder, they have increase trend for all year. It may be cause by the politics。

### Age and Class
```{r}
data %>%
  ggplot() + geom_col(aes(x= class, y = sum, fill = age), position = "fill") -> p_hist
plotly::ggplotly(p_hist)
```

Row 
----------------------------------
### Analysis

From graph. we can see that 20-34 years age are the largest people for criminal record. The 55 year and over are the smallest group.

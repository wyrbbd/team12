# Assignment 4 - team12

This is the repo for ETC5513 Assignment 4.


# The Goals of The Assignment:

- Demonstrate that you are capable of creating a **group reproducible pdf** report using RStudio, Git and GitHub using all the tools that we have learned.
- Confirm that you are able to clone a repository locally and synchronize the changes to the remote GitHub repo.
- Confirm that you can create meaningful commits so that the changes and the history of the project can be tracked.
- Show that you can create and merge branches as well as resolve conflicts.
- Please use the template provided in this repo. For this assignment, you do **not** need to modify the template. Also ensure that you do **not** include all the R code and R messages in the report output. You may choose to output code parts if those are relevant for the report output.


# Tasks 

Work in group of three (same as in Tutorial 8) to create a reproducible and collaborative report where **each team member will**:

**Select one direction from the data set and choose two research questions to answer in their section(please remember that you can use subsections within your section)** 

section1 - Analysis of different victims in Australia based on state.

section2 - Analysis of different victims in Australia based on gender.

section3 - Analysis of different victims in Australia based on age.

- Ensure that inside your section you have a **figure** and a **table** that are *both referenced in the text*.  Write a paragraph with no more than 400 words to discuss your answer to the research question in your section referring to the figure and table.
- To help you with your data wrangling and figures, have a look at the demo template of week 8 lecture. 
- In this end, this report will need to have a very short intro (no more than 150 words), three or four sections (depending on how many members are in the team) and a reference section with any relevant information.

# Data set

The dataset for this work is from the ABS website and contains the following variables:

- Gender
- Age
- State 
- Number of different types of victims
- Ratio of different types of victims - (number of victims per 100,000)
- Year 


# Logistics (very important!)

- Please nominate a person in your group to first access the repository on this link (LINK). Ensure that you are logged in into your GitHub account before using the link. Create a group with your Tutorial 8 group's name.
- Then the other group members please use the same link (LINK). Please follow the instructions, **look for your group and join the group**.
- If you encounter a 404 error, please go to the top-right corner and sign in into your GitHub account.
- Once all the group members have joined the group in GitHub classrooms, you can all start working on the project.
- Each group member must then **clone the repository in your local machine and create a branch to work on your own section**. Please name the branch using your name and surname (**name_surname**).
- Each group member will work on one section (if there are four of you in the group, please create a new section in the report.Rmd file).
- Ensure that you stage, commit and push the changes that you are making into your own branch from time to time as you are creating your own section (do not leave it all to the end).
- While you work on your section, please ensure that you work in your branch and commit and push changes into your **own branch** in the remote repository too. That will minimize conflicts.
- Also ensure that you fetch the contents of the remote repository from time to time (do not leave that to the end).
- Once your section is complete, please merge your branch into your repo and deal with any possible conflicts. 
- It might be helpful to set up a Zoom meeting with your group members once you are ready to merge your branch into the master branch to create the final report. One of the members at a time can merge his/her branch with the master while sharing screen with the others. That way you can help each other fix conflicts and that will ensure that you are not merging different branches at the same time, which might cause more complicated merging conflicts.
